    """Fixes errors and missing values in the diagnostic data and saves as csv.

    This function fixes known inconsistencies or errors in the HBN Clinician Consensus
    Diagnosis Data. First, repeated diagnoses are removed. The rest of the fixes are
    related to diagnosis certainty. As the data entry template for this dataset has
    changed over time, participants may be missing values for columns that were not
    present at the time of data entry. The changes to the certainty columns include:
        - When one of confirmed, presumptive, or requires confirmation are 1, if by
        history is missing, it should be set to 0.
        - When confirmed and presumptive are missing, if requires confirmation, rule
        out, and by history are all 0, confirmed should be 1 and presumptive 0. These
        are confirmed diagnoses from an old template version with no explicit
        "confirmed" option.
        - When confirmed and presumptive are missing, if one of requires confirmation,
        rule out, or by history are 1, confirmed and presumptive should both be 0.
        - If a diagnoses is by history, the time variable should be blank.
        - Past Documentation should only be noted for diagnoses by history or past
        diagnoses. Otherwise, this variable should be blank.
        - The "New", "PRem", and "Rem" columns are from an outdated template version and
        should be removed. This information is available elsewhere.
